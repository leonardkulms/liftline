A React app for powerlifters at gyms to log their lifts.
This is just something startup people would call "MVP". 

I decided to transfer this to a Next.js app and will open a new repo for that.

A live demo of this prototype can be found at liftline-demo.herokuapp.com

Leveraged technologies are React with hooks and SCSS.
